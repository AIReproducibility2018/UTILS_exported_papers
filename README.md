## Slightly longer overview

The Scopus search term, repeated for each of the years papers were selected from, this one for 2012.
The year is specified in the last search term of the string. The search was performed at some point in
2017.

```
KEY ( "Artificial Intelligence" ) AND NOT ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "survey" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "review" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "cp " ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "ar " ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "ch " ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "ip " ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2012 ) )
```

Below is a more readable formatting, of the same search term, but it is not guaranteed that it will
work in Scopus with newlines.

```
KEY ( "Artificial Intelligence" )
AND NOT (
     TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "survey" )
  OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "review" )
)
AND (
     LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "cp " )
  OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "ar " )
  OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "ch " )
  OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "ip " ) )
AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2012 ) )
